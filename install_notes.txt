If after installing linux distribution and trying to run gives error:

Installing, this may take a few minutes...
WslRegisterDistribution failed with error: 0xc03a001a
Error: 0xc03a001a The requested operation could not be completed due to a virtual disk system limitation.  Virtual hard disk files must be uncompressed and unencrypted and must not be sparse.


run this and reboot:

fsutil behavior set disableencryption 1
fsutil behavior set disablecompression 1


You may also need to change folder attributes in the distribution localstate folder:

C:\Users\<USER_NAME>\AppData\Local\Packages\<_DISTRO_NAME>\LocalState
example:
C:\Users\me\AppData\Local\Packages\TheDebianProject.DebianGNULinux_76v4gfsz19hv4\LocalState
